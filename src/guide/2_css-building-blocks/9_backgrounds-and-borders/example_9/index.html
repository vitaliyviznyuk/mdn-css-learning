        <p><code>background-attachment: scroll</code> causes the element's background to be fixed to the page, so that
            it scrolls when the page is scrolled. If the element content is scrolled, the background does not move.</p>

    <article class="fixed">
        <p><code>background-attachment: fixed</code> causes an element's background to be fixed to the viewport, so that
            it doesn't scroll when the page or element content is scrolled. It will always remain in the same position
            on the screen.</p>

    <article class="local">
        <p><code>background-attachment: local</code>, new to CSS3, causes an element's background to be fixed to the
            actual element itself. So When the page is scrolled, the element's background will move along with it only
            if the element does so (so not in the case of elements with <code>position: fixed</code>.) When the
            element's content is scrolled, the background will scroll along with it.</p>
