<h1>Basic document flow</h1>

<p>
    I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
    lines below me.
</p>

<p>
    By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
    as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
    border width/height.
</p>

<p>
    We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
    separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
</p>

<p>
    Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on
    the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same
    line. Overflowing inline elements will
    <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>,
    or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
    <img src="long.jpg" alt="snippet of cloth" />
